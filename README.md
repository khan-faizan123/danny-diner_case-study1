 üçΩÔ∏è Danny's Diner is the subject of a fascinating case study uploaded by Danny Ma, and it's the first of its kind.
This case study presents ten intriguing questions to solve. You can find the case study at [https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/case-study-1/].
To tackle these questions, any Relational Database tool can be utilized. I opted for MySQL to solve them.
Each question offers an opportunity to enhance your SQL skills. Let's dive in and explore the culinary data of Danny's Diner!"
Here is the problem statement we are trying to solve:
Danny wants to use the data to answer a few simple questions about his customers, especially about their visiting patterns, how much money they‚Äôve spent and also which menu items are their favourite. Having this deeper connection with his customers will help him deliver a better and more personalised experience for his loyal customers.
He plans on using these insights to help him decide whether he should expand the existing customer loyalty program - additionally he needs help to generate some basic datasets so his team can easily inspect the data without needing to use SQL.
